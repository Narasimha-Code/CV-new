# ðŸ”„ Before & After Comparison Feature

## Overview

The CV Creator now includes a comprehensive **Before & After Comparison** section that shows users exactly what changed between their original resume and the AI-tailored version.

## What's New

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/comparison`

  "after": {
    "skills_count": 18,
    "keyword_matches": 12,
    "keyword_match_score": 0.80
  },

    "skills_added": ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "CI/CD"],
    "new_keywords_matched": ["DevOps", "Cloud", "AWS"],
    "improvement": {
      "keyword_score_increase": 0.27,
      "keyword_count_increase": 4,
      "percentage_improvement": 27.0
    }
  },
  "customizations": [
    "Generated professional summary aligned with job role",

tailored_matched = [kw for kw in job_keywords if kw in tailored_text]

# Calculate improvement
improvement = {
    "keyword_score_increase": tailored_score - original_score,
    "keyword_count_increase": len(tailored_matched) - len(original_matched),
    "percentage_improvement": ((tailored_score - original_score) * 100)
}
```

### Frontend Display

```javascript
// Fetch comparison data
const comparisonResponse = await fetch('/api/comparison');
const comparison = await comparisonResponse.json();

// Display stats
document.getElementById('before-keywords').textContent = comparison.before.keyword_matches;
document.getElementById('after-keywords').textContent = comparison.after.keyword_matches;

// Show improvement
const improvementText = `ðŸŽ‰ Improved by ${improvement.percentage_improvement}%!`;
```

## API Usage Example
